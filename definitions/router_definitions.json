/*
The purpose of this file is to separate request routing from the specific values appropriate for the API.

All API specific values should be specified here so that the code itself can remain agnostic to the particular API it's used for.

pathroot:  The root resource of the API and perhaps the name of the DB instance it uses
routes:  Contain all of the information needed to accurately route the request for fulfillment.  It includes:

pathlength:  How long the corresponding request path is for this route (1 based)
pathname:  The most specific resource that the path is requesting (commonly plural like what is used in the path)
resourcetype:  The type of the resource that the request is specifying (typcially singular)
querystring:  Is a query string applicable (never required)
links:  An array of JSON objects that define the 'links' HTTP response attribute.  Contains:

name: The 'rel' name of the link
path: The partial path string to be used.
